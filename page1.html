            <hr>
            <p>Elsword: Elsword is a master swordsman that excels at close range combat. He's quick on his feet and can hack and slash with the best of them. Not only can he dish it out, but he can take a lot of punishment as well. His only real weakness is magic, but in his mind, there's nothing a sharp piece of steel can't beat. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Way of the Sword<br>
                Three Paths: Sword Knight > Lord Knight<br>

            <p>Aisha: Aisha is a mage who relies on her spell-casting abilities to inflict major damage to an opponent. She also has the abilities to attack multiple targets at once. All of the Mage's spells are elemental, meaning she can gain an advantage by tailoring her attacks to a monsters natural element. In hand to hand combat, she favors the staff.  </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Memorize<br>
                Three Paths: High Magician > Elemental Master<br>

                Battle Magician > Dimension Witch</p>

             <p>Rena: Rena is a marksman with ranged weapons but can call on the elements to fuel her magic attacks as well. When cornered though, she has no problem striking enemies with her awesome kicks. She also has the ability to seemingly fly through the air with her double jump.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Nature's Force<br>
                Three Paths: Shooting Ranger > Grand Archer<br>
                Combat Ranger > Wind Sneaker<br>
                Trapping Ranger > Night Watcher</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For full details on Rena: <a href="http://elwiki.net/w/Rena">Rena</a></p>
             <p>Raven: Raven excels in close combat as he uses his Nasod arm to strike down enemies with a single blow to those who dare get near him. He also uses his sword to slice up anything in his path in order to build up all sorts of combos to tear down the enemy.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability:Anger of Raven<br>
                Three Paths: Sword Taker > Blade Master<br>
                Over Taker > Reckless Fist<br>
                Weapon Taker > Veteran Commander</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For full details on Raven: <a href="http://elwiki.net/w/Raven">Raven</a></p>
             <p>Eve: Eve may not look tough like the others, but she uses her powers of machinery to take down enemy forces for her. Since Eve is the Queen of Nasods, she can summon Nasods from her kingdom to aid her in her battle.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Core Release System<br>
                Three Paths: Code: Architecture > Code: Empress<br>
                Code: Exotic > Code: Nemesis<br>
                Code: Electra > Code: Battle Seraph</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For full details on Eve: <a href="http://elwiki.net/w/Eve">Eve</a></p>
             <p>Chung: Chungâ€™s weapon is the large cannon called the Destroyer, and his armor is the full body panoply called Freiturnier. In spite of his young and delicate looks, he can freely handle the big cannon with a tough combat style. His creed: no innocent human will get hurt under his watch.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Freiturnier<br>
                Three Paths: Fury Guardian > Iron Paladin<br>
                Shooting Guardian > Deadly Chaser<br>
                Shelling Guardian > Tactical Trooper</p>
            </blockquote>

             <p>Ara: Ara is a skilled martial artist that uses a spear. She is a highly versatile character, with extremely long melee attack range, as well as superior attack speed and mobility. Having an air-dash in addition to the double jump, Ara's aerial mobility rivals that of Eve, who is known for having remarkable overall movement freedom. Her range also allows her to catch enemies in her combos from a safe distance, and even hit enemies behind, above, and below her easily. Ara also has a unique trait to her different from others, as she uses "Spirit Energy" which can be used as substitution of MP.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability:Eun<br>
                Three Paths: Little Hsien > Sakra Devanam<br>
                Little Devil > Yama Raja<br>
                Little Specter > Asura</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For full details on Ara: <a href="http://elwiki.net/w/Ara">Ara</a></p>
             <p>Elesis: Elesis is as fierce as she is calculated, expressing sedate attacks with her claymore onto her enemies. Although wielding a mighty claymore, Elesis herself is agile. She is able to evade and gap close with extreme effect unlike her brother Elsword, who incorporates a more defensive fighting-style. In addition to her swordplay, Elesis is capable of harnessing and expressing energy into fire, enhancing her combat effectiveness.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Chivalry<br>
                Three Paths: Saber Knight > Grand Master<br>
                Pyro Knight > Blazing Heart<br>
                ??? Knight > ???????</p>
            </blockquote>

             <p>Add: Staying true to his concept of being a mechanic, Add fully utilizes his mechanized weapon; the 'Nasod Dynamo', to aid him in battle. The Dynamos are not only able deal physical damage to targets, but are also able to fire rays of electricity as a way of dealing magical damage. As a ranged alternative, his dynamos can also be configured to form a powerful electricity cannon by the same way. Add is able to manipulate the electricity the cannon fires by either using his hands or kicking to fire powerful electrical blasts. This allows his attack style to freely transition between long and close range attacks. Another aspect of Add is that some of his skills have the concept of 'Magnetism', allowing numerous homing attacks which compensates for his low HP and physical defense values.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Special Ability: Dynamo Point (DP) System<br>
                Three Paths: Psychic Tracer > Lunatic Psyker<br>
                Arc Tracer > Mastermind<br>
                ??? Tracer > ????????</p>
            </blockquote>
